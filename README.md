### MLAPI-Plus

MLAPI-Plus is a fork of MidLevel/MLAPI that will reflect all the changes I had to do to make it suitable for the fast-paced competitive multiplayer game I'm currently developing which uses a client/server architecture with dedicated servers.

I will be adding any features I need like client-side prediction and server reconciliation as well as changing anything that obstructs what the game needs to use the minimum bandwidth, to have as low latency as possible, the smoothest synchronization and minimum processing requirements to reduce server costs.

I will also develop some real world usage examples of the framework based on my game later on.

As for the default transport I removed the deprecated UNET and chose MidLevel/Ruffles because it looks like the best managed LLAPI out there and was made by the same developer of MLAPI. If the original developer is reading this, thank you for MLAPI and Ruffles, they're really good. ðŸ™‚

After the game's release into production I also intend to commit all bugs and problems I can fix as well as submitting pull requests to the original repository (if applicable).

### Installation

Right now it's still in development but if you would like to try just add these two lines in the manifest.json of your Unity project:

```json
{
    "com.cakeslice.mlapi": "https://github.com/cakeslice/MLAPI-Plus.git?path=/MLAPI",
    "com.cakeslice.mlapi_editor": "https://github.com/cakeslice/MLAPI-Plus.git?path=/MLAPI-Editor"
}
```

MLAPI (Mid level API) is a framework that simplifies building networked games in Unity. It offers **low level** access to core networking while at the same time offering **high level** abstractions. The MLAPI aims to remove the repetetive tasks and reduces the network code dramatically, no matter how many of the **modular** features you use.

The MLAPI has features matched by nobody else, any more features are added when requested. The MLAPI is constantly evolving. Read about our features [here](https://mlapi.network/features/).

### Getting Started

To get started, check the [Wiki](https://mlapi.network/wiki/).
This is also where most documentation lies. Follow the [quickstart](https://mlapi.network/wiki/installation/), join our [discord](http://discord.mlapi.network/) and get started today!

### Support

For bug reports or feature requests you want to propose, please use the Issue Tracker on GitHub. For general questions, networking advice or to discuss changes before proposing them, please use the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/FM8SE9E).

### Compatibility

The MLAPI is built to work everywhere. It will run in the web, on many Unity versions, .NET runtimes and such.

The requirements for the MLAPI are:

-   Unity >= 2017

### Special thanks

Special thanks to [Gabriel Tofvesson](https://github.com/GabrielTofvesson) for writing the BitWriter, BitReader & ECDH implementation.

### Issues and missing features

If there are any issues, bugs or features that are missing. Please open an issue on the GitHub [issues page](https://github.com/MidLevel/MLAPI/issues).

### Example

Here is a sample MonoBehaviour showing a chat script where everyone can write and read from. This shows the basis of the MLAPI and the abstractions it adds.

```csharp
public class Chat : NetworkedBehaviour
{
    private NetworkedList<string> ChatMessages = new NetworkedList<string>(new MLAPI.NetworkedVar.NetworkedVarSettings()
    {
        ReadPermission = MLAPI.NetworkedVar.NetworkedVarPermission.Everyone,
        WritePermission = MLAPI.NetworkedVar.NetworkedVarPermission.Everyone,
        SendTickrate = 5
    }, new List<string>());

    private string textField = "";

    private void OnGUI()
    {
        if (IsClient)
        {
            textField = GUILayout.TextField(textField, GUILayout.Width(200));

            if (GUILayout.Button("Send") && !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(textField))
            {
                ChatMessages.Add(textField);
                textField = "";
            }

            for (int i = ChatMessages.Count - 1; i >= 0; i--)
            {
                GUILayout.Label(ChatMessages[i]);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
